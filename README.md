You can ignore this project for now; I am just trying to
learn backbone.js.

In the best case, this webapp will somewhere in the future
be usable for keeping track of the scores while playing
whist. (4-6 players, 0, 1 or 2 'pissers').

But it is also possible that this project will just die.

mockup.html contains a sort of mockup. The real app will be in
index.html.
